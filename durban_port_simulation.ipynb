Each row is a truck, and each column is a milestone time (e.g., gate-in start/end, pickup start). Use this to verify that timestamps are present, ordered sensibly, and that the dataset has the expected structure before plotting or analysis.\n"

Each histogram shows the distribution of a key wait or dwell metric, helping you see typical values and long-delay tails. The scatter plot relates yard occupancy to move time, which shows whether congestion slows operations. Together, these charts diagnose bottlenecks in scanning, yard equipment, loading, gates, and overall time in port. The vessel plots show marine-side congestion (anchorage wait), crane allocation by pier, and berth utilization, which indicate berth capacity pressure.\n\nUse these as the baseline reference when comparing improvements or policy changes.\n"

A leftward shift of the improved curve means faster processing (less waiting or dwell); a rightward shift means slower. These comparisons highlight which interventions reduce delays in scanning, yard moves, loading, gate processing, and total time in port.\n\nWhen teaching, emphasize that we are comparing *distributions*, not just averages\u2014so we can see if improvements reduce long tails and congestion peaks.\n"
