# Sources and Data Provenance

This repo includes a limited set of source material and processed data outputs.

## Included in the repo
- `data/benchmarks/port_efficiency_benchmarks.md` (benchmark ranges and suggested sensitivity tests).
- `data/processed/unit_volume/*` (processed unit volume outputs and ingestion log).
- `data/processed/port_terminals_kpis/*` (extracted KPI tables and ingestion log).
- `figures/` (plots from prior runs).

## Not included in the repo
- The raw reports referenced by ingestion scripts live under `$backup/data_reports/` in this workspace and are not part of the repo.
- The source file referenced in older notes (`/mnt/data/pasted.txt`) is missing; parameters linked to it are treated as assumptions.
